Mictlan is an Ecommerce application for Magic the Gathering cards with image upload functionality. 
- Built with Django framework.
- The application allows buying, selling and trade of Magic the Gathering Cards. 
 

Theme:
Mictlan is the underworld of Aztec mythology, a name fitting for a website dedicated to a game full 
of creatures - from vampires to zombies to dragons to necromancers, just to name a few. The Aztec also
had the most important market in Mexico, so the idea of an ecommerce application with a marketplace 
and bidding fit the overarching theme of the application. 


Below are images of some features of the application: 
- Account registration
- Product submission form that allows user to upload a product with an image and description
- Marketplace where registered users can browse through uploaded cards
- A bidding square unique to each posting where buyers/seller can interact
